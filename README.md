## Working with Data Sources using SQL (SQLite)
The types of operations SQL can perform are often referred to as CRUD, or "create, read, update, delete". Most databases consist of multiple tables of data. Like a table in a spreadsheet, a database table consists of rows and columns which are often called records (rows) and fields (columns).

| Command | Description|
| ------- | ---------- |
| `SELECT`| selection |
| `*` | special character meaning 'all' |
| , | to reduce number of field shown from `SELECT`, use comma as separator | 
| `FROM` | where to read data from |
| `LIMIT` | returns the number of rows returned |
